        <p>I grew up in Park City, Utah where I spent my childhood playing outdoors skiing and mountain biking.
          After graduating school, I sought a career in the outdoor industry because it is something that I believe
          in.
          In 2018, my girlfriend (a native Oregonian) and I decided to pack up our lives and move to the Northwest.
          We recently settled in Hood River, OR where I am currently working for Dakine equipment, a manufacturer of
          outdoor
          gear.
          I enrolled in Epicodus to explore a longtime interest in coding and expand my career options.</p>
